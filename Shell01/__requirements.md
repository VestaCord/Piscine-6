## Instructions
    • These exercises are carefully arranged in order of difficulty, from easiest to hardest. We will not consider a successfully completed harder exercise if an easier one is not perfectly functional.
    • Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions on your files and directories.
    • You must follow the submission procedures for every exercise.
    • Your exercises will be checked and graded by your fellow classmates.
    • Additionally, your exercises will be checked and graded by a program called Moulinette.
    • Moulinette is extremely meticulous and strict in its evaluation. It is entirely automated, and there is no way to negotiate with it. To avoid unpleasant surprises,
    be as thorough as possible.
    • Shell exercises must be executable with /bin/sh.
    • You must not leave any additional files in your directory other than those specified
    in the assignment.
